React Life Cycle

	1. Initial Phase - components gets its life - they get initilized in VM
		it containts all the default props and state declared, the one which are 
			declared in the constructor

			To check which props and state were there
			u can use

			a. getDefaultProps()
			b. getInitialState() 	
				very much asked in an interview
	once done
	
	2. Mount Phase- Component Mount (i.e, Component will get attached to Virtual DOM)
			
			a. componentWillMount() -put anything here - change the security / encodeing / 						decoding techniques
			b. componentDidMount()  - initilize all the imp variables
			c. render() - put ur HTML, css, loop throught the data etc....
	3. Updateing Phase - changes to data, changes to UI, changes to IP Address 
			very imp phase
			a. componentWillRecieveProps()
				The new props values will be coming here
			
				lets say, current values are 
				offerPrice = 25000;

				prices keeps changeing, in the parent component, thus in the parent 					component, it is 
				offerPrice = 26000; //new price, the old price is lost, overridden
						and this is happening every 4 hours
				we want to keep a array variable which will store the previous 				data,along with 
				time, who updated it and, reason and everything

		sometimes, you want your component to be very static after been created

			b. componentShouldUpdate()
			c. componentWillUpdate() 
			d. componentDidUpdate() - make a log entery here, send some notification

	4. componentwillUnmount() - user is closeing the app,or a tab (logout link is still a 					component)
