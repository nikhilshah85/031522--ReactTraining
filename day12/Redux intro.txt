React
	a. Component
		Class based component
		Function based component
	b. Props and States
	c. React Hooks
	d. Router to create a SPA 
	e. Make Rest API calls (fetch api and Axios)
	f. ES6 and 7 map function, spread operator

	--------------------------------------------------------------
	This looks good so far, we can easily create a Mid size application for the same 

	Bigger apps are create with more flexibility

	For enterprise app, we always work with pattern

		Thus we follow a pattern - Redux (Ecosystem) - big apps like Instagram (create better application)

		React-Readux
			somepattern used for client end
			1. MVC - used in angular early days
			2. Component - React used it first and used by angular and backbone
			3. MVVM - used by bootstrap, backbone knockout etc.
			4. Flux - using flux community of developer created a small framework for react app
				This was really really good and allowed to manage and plan big applications
				Facebook took over the community, modified the framework, and called it as Redux
			

	React challanges
		a. Data management becomes very difficult (state)
		b. lots of methods, communicaiton, classes, object, memory managemnet etc....becomes a difficult to manage

	
	Redux is based on react (more simplified, but lengthy)

			component was responsible to have (1 single file)
				functions (for data manipulations, user actions, state update)
				state and props management
				passing and recieving the data with other components
				make api calls 
		it has 4 parts
			a. container (this is the state of an application) - we use to create state in the parent class
									also we had state at multiple places
					now we will have it as centeralised location
			b. Reducer (actions are declared)
			c. Actions (actions are defined, states are updated)
			d. providers (pass the state to various component)
