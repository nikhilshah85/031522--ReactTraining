	This looks good so far, we can easily create a Mid size application for the same 

	Bigger apps are create with more flexibility

	For enterprise app, we always work with pattern

		Thus we follow a pattern - Redux (Ecosystem) - big apps like Instagram (create better application)

		React-Readux
			somepattern used for client end
			1. MVC - used in angular early days
			2. Component - React used it first and used by angular and backbone
			3. MVVM - used by bootstrap, backbone knockout etc.
			4. Flux - using flux community of developer created a small framework for react app
				This was really really good and allowed to manage and plan big applications
				Facebook took over the community, modified the framework, and called it as Redux
