Functional Component - ES6
	Working with data becomes a challange
		Props and States

in React 16.8 - Hooks, which will make devlopers code easy to work with daata

	It is an inbuilt part of framework for data management

	They are available as a function

		useState - some good operators from ES6 which also got added (...) use of spread operator, light weigh to handle change
	

	Since this is functional component, it is more static in nature
		thus we will not be able to change the value for emp, in some function, 
		also since it is not a class where we can bind the function with in the construcor to be known to VD

		Thus we have useState function, with 2 parameters, 2nd para being the function it self

		When a function component, when ever a state value changes, the component is re-rendered


Tomorrow
	we have an example on 
		useRef (this is the best hook for performance and to deal with the inputs)
			very light weight
	create a customHook

	we jsut have useState
		     useEffect
		    useRef

	we end creating custom hooks for an app
