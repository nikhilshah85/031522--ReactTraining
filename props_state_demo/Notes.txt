1. Modern Web - Web Revolution
2. Setup - NodeJS, VS Code, Installed react using NPM 
3. First React APP, Components
4. ES6-ES7 - JS is now OOPS, classes, methods, variables, properties, constructor etc.
5. Passing data from parent to child using props
	props allowed us to pass data from parent to child (its one way)
	props are mutable, if you make a change in parent propery (empName)
		and when same is passed to child, when value in parent changes, 
			changes will not reflect in child

	States are not mutable

	Todays Agenda 
		Props
		State
		map function (very imp)



	There are 4 types of data React deals with (this data generally comes from Rest)

	a. plain variable - empName = "Nikhil"
	b. plain array  -  skills:['React','Angular','Azure Cloud','.Net','SQL Server']
	c. JSON Object - empDetails:{ firstName:'Nikhil', lastName:'Shah',age:30,isPermenant:true }
	d. JSON Object Array - empList:[
{ firstName:'Nikhil',lastName:'Shah',age:30,isPermenant:true },
{ firstName:'Nikhil', lastName:'Shah',age:30,isPermenant:true },
{ firstName:'Nikhil', lastName:'Shah',age:30,isPermenant:true },
{ firstName:'Nikhil', lastName:'Shah',age:30,isPermenant:true },
{ firstName:'Nikhil', lastName:'Shah',age:30,isPermenant:true },
{ firstName:'Nikhil', lastName:'Shah',age:30,isPermenant:true },

	Map function from ES is used to iterate throught the collections
