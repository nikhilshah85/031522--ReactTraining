1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useRef 



myName = useState('Nikhil');
myAge = useState(30);
myProfile = useState(false);
myContact = useState({email:'nik@somehwere.com',phone:403298,mobile:98989});
mySkills = useState(['React','Angular','.Net'])

there is a better way to declare as well

we use to have a function, which can make chnges to state
this function then needs to be binded
	Why ?

also you can change state in multiple functions in a class based component, this is not a good discipline
	change the myName in 2 or 3 places 
		editProfile()
		{
			this.setState({myName:'Nikhil Shah'});
		}

		changeMyName()
		{
			this.setState({myName:'Nikhil Shah'});
		}



useState( para1, para2);

para1 is the varaible - eg myName
para2 is the function - which can change its value;
